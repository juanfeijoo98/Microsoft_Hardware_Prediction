# 🔥 Microsoft Hardware Failure Prediction 🔍

This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict hardware failures, using models such as **Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting**. By applying **hyperparameter optimization**, we improved performance and selected the best model based on **accuracy and AUC scores**.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🛠 **Objective**: Predict potential hardware failures before they occur.
- 📊 **Approach**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
- 🚀 **Models Used**: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- 🎯 **Key Metrics**: Model accuracy and AUC for performance evaluation.
